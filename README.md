# Huh? He makes his projects public too?!?!?
Well, no. I was bored and I wanted to push something to GitHub and fumble around with Godot so made this in 2 minutes. I'll add good elements to it soon. For now, the main focus is on a different repo _and it is private_.

By the way, this project is heavily inspired by Max's silly lil game jam where he tortured me to stay awake till 3 AM to game a game in scratch within an hour. The game didn't work ofc so here it is (or will be in the future).
